Opal Kelly Functions List
Functions to interface with Opal Kelly API.

WARNING: Some functions may require Opal Kelly FPGA device to be connected to the PC running
the software to properly test. This also requires the "ok" package to be imported from Opal Kelly.
An error will occur if the appropriate package is not imported.
